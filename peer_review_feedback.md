| Reviewee's Project Name | 1. Identify and describe three strengths in this ERD.                                                                                                                                     | 2. Identify and describe three weaknesses in this ERD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | 3. How does this draft meet the requirements of the assignment? If not, what is it missing?                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 4. After seeing this, I was left wondering . . .                                                                                                                                                                        |

| csjobdatabase           | 1-) Good selection of primary key for company entity.  2-) (Applications) entity have strong attributes 3-) Relation between application and company is one of the strengths of this ERD. | 1-) Result entity is unnecessary here. It contains two attributes which suits in company entity.T 2-) Company ID used as primary key in application entity which makes no sense because there could be multiple jobs in same company. So, instead of company ID they should've created application ID or something similar. 3-)  The foreign keys are not assigned properly.                                                       | Well, this diagram does fulfill the requirement. However, as we mentioned above (result) entity is something extra and can be replaced with better entity such as applicant information (entity) or something likewise.                                                                                             | Not completely as we all are trying our best and since this is our first time dealing with databases. However, some of the decisions made me wonder for instance the primary key part which was a little hard to catch. |
| csJobDatabse            | 1. 'Applications' entity has strong attributes. 2. Good selection of a primary key for the entity 'company'.                                                                              | 1. The project could have been done without using the 'Results' entity. It could have been included as an attribute for the 'Applications' entity. 2. The foreign keys are not designated properly. It's hard to establish a relationship between the entities. 3. The entity 'Application' can have same 'CompanyID' for multiple applications. Hence it would be hard to distinguish between different entries of 'Applications' | The team tried their best to meet the requirements for the assignment but I'd say there could have been some better options to do so. Like for eg. Instead of the 'Result' entity, they could have come up with a different entity perhaps. (as result can be added into one of the attributes for 'Applications'). | That with proper implementation, this project idea would be of great help.                                                                                                                                              |
